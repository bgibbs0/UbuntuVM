<h1>Ubuntu Virtual Machine</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this lab, I will be setting up a Ubuntu Linux virutal machine using VMware Workstation Player 16. With the creation of this virtual machine, I will be able to expand my knowledge of Linux and improve my skills. </br>

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>
Ubuntu - Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software. </br>
VMware Workstation - A type 2 hypervisor developed by VMware that allows for the creation of virtual machines. 

<h2>Glossary</h2>
ISO file - An exact copy of an entire optical disk such as a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray archived into a single file. </br>
</br>
Linux - A family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel. </br>
</br>
Network Address Translation - A method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. </br>
</br>
Open-Source - Any program whose source code is made available for use or modification as users or other developers see fit. </br>
</br>
Type 2 Hypervisor - A Type 2 hypervisor, also called a hosted hypervisor, is a virtual machine (VM) manager that is installed as a software application on an existing operating. </br>
</br>
Virtual Machine - A compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. </br>


<h2>Lab Walkthrough</h2>

To start off the walkthrough, I navigated to the Ubuntu website. </br>

</br>

I then navigated to Ubuntu Desktop and downloaded `Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS`. This download will include a ISO file that I will be able to deploy in VMware Workstation. </br>

After downloading the `Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS` ISO file, I opened VMware Workstation to begin the virtual machine set up. </br>

</br>

I chose the ISO file path from my downloads folder `C:\Users\brian\Downloads\ubuntu-22.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso`. </br>

</br>

From here I began configuring the virtual machine. I allocated 20 GB for the hard drive as per the recommended amount, 4 GB of memory and the Network Adapter will be using NAT (Network Address Translation). </br>

With the virtual machine now configured, I was able to spin it up and go through the normal Ubuntu Desktop set up. </br>

After successfully logging in, I was welcomed with the Ubuntu Desktop user interface. With the virtual machine now deployed, I am able to open a bash terminal and begin my Linux journey! </br>
